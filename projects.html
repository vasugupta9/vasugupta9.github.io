<h2>Consulting Projects </h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Analysed and implemented algorithms for estimation of melanin and hemoglobin distribution in face regions from
images captured using mobile selfie camera for a Canada based healthcare startup.</b> <br /> 
<i>Client Feedback : Vasu was very quick to implement the methods we suggested, he also understood the underlying theory and contributed many valuable ideas and insights. He also brought new tools to bear on the problem. I highly recommend. Vasu has excellent practical skill as well as theoretical understanding.</i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Trained Mask RCNN model for segmentation of cattle from aerial imagery</b></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Implemented OpenCV project for detection and counting of shapes (cut-outs in 3D printed blocks)</b> <br />
<i>Client Feedback : I can recommend Vasu without reservation. He was open to discuss details in advance of the project. The implementation itself was blazing fast and really well documented. 
He even did some cleanups and optimizations after the project was closed. I really look forward to working with him again! </i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Machine learning specialist needed with experience in Tensorflow, Keras, RNN, and LSTM</b> <br />
<i>Client Feedback : Vasu was a pleasure to work with - knowledgeable, timely with responses, and offering differing solutions. </i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Time series modeling and analysis</b> <br />
<i>Client Feedback : This is my second time working with Vasu. His skills and creativity are unparalleled. It's been a pleasure interacting with him. </i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Bulk PDF word search and frequency</b> <br />
<i>Client Feedback : I very highly recommend Vasu, and will look for opportunities to work with him again. He responded thoughtfully and constructively to my brief, answering the questions set but also proposing an alternative approach, which we ended up adopting. His technical skills are evidently very high, and he has excellent standards of communication. Finally, he documented the work clearly and precisely, which wasn't specifically asked for, but a real mark of professionalism. </i></p>
